## Ingredients

- ¾ cup white sugar

- ¼ cup light olive oil

- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

- ½ teaspoon almond extract

- 2 large eggs

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

- 1 teaspoon baking powder

- ¼ teaspoon salt

- 1 ½ cups pistachio nuts

- ½ cup dried cranberries

## Directions

### Step1

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

### Step2

Mix sugar and oil together in a large bowl until well blended. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts, then beat in eggs. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture until combined. Fold in pistachios and cranberries by hand.

### Step3

Divide dough in half. Form each piece into a 12x2-inch log on the prepared cookie sheet. Dough may be sticky; wet hands with cool water to handle dough more easily.

### Step4

Bake in the preheated oven until logs are light brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.

### Step5

Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).

### Step6

Cut logs on the diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Lay cookies cut-side down on the cookie sheet.

### Step7

Bake cookies until dry, 8 to 10 minutes.
